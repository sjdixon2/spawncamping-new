SENG513 Project
## Notes on Running Project:

# Database Configuration
- in order to deploy to your own database, you have to migrate the database.  On linux you can do this by running 'migrate.sh' in the base folder.

- the database settings are given in config/index.js

- the database settings can optionally be overriden in config/test.js, config/production.js, and config/development.js

# Running the Application

simply run 'app.js'. Everything else takes care of itself.

# Other Configurations
- there are 3 modes: production, development, and test.  By default, "development" is active.
You can change this by changing the environmental NODE_ENV to 'test', 'development', or 'production'.

Some Migration Notes:
Updated: April 4, 2014

- I don't think this project works if you just apply the migrations manually
- you have to, at the minimum, add the 'extension' column to Photoes
- you may also want to get rid of 'imagePath' and 'thumbnailPath' while you're at it.
- the most recent migration attempts this but I saw mixed results depending on where it was deployed
